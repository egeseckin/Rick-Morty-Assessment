# Rick-Morty-Assessment
 
Rick And Morty Assessment

I builded a Rick And Morty character cards app which can be filtered to see only Rick or Morty.
- Used Apollo(GrapQL) and SnapKit
- Used Longinus for faster image renders
- Created on Xcode 13.4.1
- for iOS 15.0+

How to run:
- Download the project from main branch 
- Open Rick-Morty-Assessment.xcodeproj
- After indexing finished on xcode, click on the any ios phone to run (ex. iPhone 12) then run it

About the app:

- When user open the app all the characters are listed without any filter.
- User can scroll until the end of character count.
- Characters can be filtered between Rick and Morty
